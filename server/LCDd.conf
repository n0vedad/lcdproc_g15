# LCDd.conf -- configuration file for the LCDproc server daemon LCDd
#
# This file contains the configuration for the LCDd server.
#
# The format is ini-file-like. It is divided into sections that start at
# markers that look like [section]. Comments are all line-based comments,
# and are lines that start with '#' or ';'.
#
# The server has a 'central' section named [server]. For the menu there is
# a section called [menu]. Further each driver has a section which
# defines how the driver acts.
#
# The drivers are activated by specifying them in a driver= line in the
# server section, like:
#
#   Driver=curses
#
# This tells LCDd to use the curses driver.
# The first driver that is loaded and is capable of output defines the
# size of the display. The default driver to use is curses.
# If the driver is specified using the -d <driver> command line option,
# the Driver= options in the config file are ignored.
#
# The drivers read their own options from the respective sections.


## Server section with all kinds of settings for the LCDd server ##
[server]

# Where can we find the driver modules ?
# IMPORTANT: Make sure to change this setting to reflect your
#            specific setup! Otherwise LCDd won't be able to find
#            the driver modules and will thus not be able to
#            function properly.
# NOTE: Always place a slash as last character !
DriverPath=/usr/lib/lcdproc/

# Tells the server to load the given drivers. Multiple lines can be given.
# The name of the driver is case sensitive and determines the section
# where to look for further configuration options of the specific driver
# as well as the name of the dynamic driver module to load at runtime.
# The latter one can be changed by giving a File= directive in the
# driver specific section.
#
# The following drivers are supported in this fork:
#   g15, linux_input
Driver=g15
Driver=linux_input

# Tells the driver to bind to the given interface. [default: 127.0.0.1]
Bind=127.0.0.1

# Listen on this specified port. [default: 13666]
Port=13666

# Sets the reporting level; defaults to warnings and errors only.
# [default: 2; legal: 0-5]
ReportLevel=5

# Should we report to syslog instead of stderr? [default: no; legal: yes, no]
#ReportToSyslog=no

# User to run as.  LCDd will drop its root privileges and run as this user
# instead. [default: nobody]
User=nobody

# The server will stay in the foreground if set to yes.
# [default: no, legal: yes, no]
#Foreground=yes

# Hello message: each entry represents a display line; default: builtin
#Hello="  Welcome to"
#Hello="   LCDproc!"

# GoodBye message: each entry represents a display line; default: builtin
#GoodBye="Thanks for using"
#GoodBye="   LCDproc!"

# Sets the interval in microseconds for updating the display.
# [default: 125000 meaning 8Hz]
#FrameInterval=125000

# Sets the default time in seconds to displays a screen. [default: 4]
#WaitTime=5

# If set to no, LCDd will start with screen rotation disabled. This has the
# same effect as if the ToggleRotateKey had been pressed. Rotation will start
# if the ToggleRotateKey is pressed. Note that this setting does not turn off
# priority sorting of screens. [default: on; legal: on, off]
AutoRotate=off

# If yes, the the serverscreen will be rotated as a usual info screen. If no,
# it will be a background screen, only visible when no other screens are
# active. The special value 'blank' is similar to no, but only a blank screen
# is displayed. [default: on; legal: on, off, blank]
ServerScreen=no

# Set master backlight setting. If set to 'open' a client may control the
# backlight for its own screens (only). [default: open; legal: off, open, on]
#Backlight=open

# Set master heartbeat setting. If set to 'open' a client may control the
# heartbeat for its own screens (only). [default: open; legal: off, open, on]
#Heartbeat=off

# set title scrolling speed [default: 10; legal: 0-10]
TitleSpeed=0

# The "...Key=" lines define what the server does with keypresses that
# don't go to any client. The ToggleRotateKey stops rotation of screens, while
# the PrevScreenKey and NextScreenKey go back / forward one screen (even if
# rotation is disabled.
# Assign the key string returned by the driver to the ...Key setting. These
# are the defaults:
ToggleRotateKey=
PrevScreenKey=Down
NextScreenKey=Up
#ScrollUpKey=Up
#ScrollDownKey=Down


## The menu section. The menu is an internal LCDproc client. ##
[menu]
# If true the server allows transitions between different client's menus
# [default: false; legal: true, false]
#PermissiveGoto=false

# You can configure what keys the menu should use. Note that the MenuKey
# will be reserved exclusively, the others work in shared mode.

# Up to six keys are supported. The MenuKey (to enter and exit the menu), the
# EnterKey (to select values) and at least one movement keys are required.
# These are the default key assignments:
MenuKey=Escape
EnterKey=Enter
UpKey=Up
DownKey=Down
#LeftKey=Left
#RightKey=Right
