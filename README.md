# LCDproc Fork for G15 Devices

This is a specialized fork from the [official LCDproc repository](https://github.com/lcdproc/lcdproc) optimized specifically for Logitech G15 keyboards.

## Introduction

LCDproc G15 is a client/server suite designed exclusively for Logitech G15 keyboards with integrated LCD displays.
The G15 driver supports the 160x43 pixel monochrome LCD display found on Logitech G15 keyboards, providing system information display capabilities.

Various clients are available that display things like CPU load, system load, memory usage, uptime, and more directly on your G15's LCD screen.

The client and server communicate via TCP connection, allowing remote monitoring capabilities.

## Installation

Refer to [INSTALL](INSTALL.md) (included with this archive) for installation
instructions (including how to connect an LCD to your system) and Prerequesites.

# Changes

This fork has been stripped down to include only the G15 driver and essential components.
